<p>Converts a <strong>not-null</strong> AudioTrack into its data representation, which is then used for various purposes.</p>
<p>The data representation is used mainly by clients in order to play media sources, as passing/storing
an entire JSON Object is a little harder and less performant.</p>
<p>Additionally, Basalt makes no requests in order to resolve the track data as it already has been resolved.
When converting strings via the <a href="to-audio-track.html">toAudioTrack</a> method, similarly, Basalt doesn't have
to make requests in order to decode the track as the data already contains all the information.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><a name="track"></a>
<code>track</code> - The track object to be encoded.</p>
<p><strong>Return</strong><br/>
The encoded data of the track.</p>
