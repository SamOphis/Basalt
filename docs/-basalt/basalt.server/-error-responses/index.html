<h1>ErrorResponses</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">ErrorResponses</span></code>
<p>An enum of responses that are returned in Dispatched <code>ERROR</code> Responses, as they're written here.</p>
<p>This means that, for example, if you tried to set the volume of a player to -5, an <code>ERROR</code> event would be
dispatched (as in wrapped in a Dispatch Response and sent back) in response with the value being
"VOLUME_OUT_OF_BOUNDS".</p>
