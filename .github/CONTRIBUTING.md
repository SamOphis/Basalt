# Contributing

Firstly, thanks for contributing to Basalt! I have limited time available now and so I can't maintain active development of
Basalt for super-long periods of time. Besides all that, your contribution must match a couple of points before it can be accepted:

* If your contribution edits a file which has documentation, you must reflect the changes in the documentation too. That doesn't
mean you have to add documentation to new files, but it means you must maintain documentation correctly in already-documented files
which you edit. In Kotlin files, use Markdown + HTML for formatting.
* Secondly, your contribution must be written in a JVM-based language which can interact fully with the other code (and vice-versa).
I strongly recommend making your contributions in Kotlin for a wide range of reasons, but I accept Java and possibly even Scala
if need be.
* Thirdly, **never** try to merge your PR into the `master` branch. The `master` branch is only for code which has been
documented, released and is proven to be stable. Either base it on a development branch or one of the feature branches.
* And finally, **follow common sense**. Don't try submitting PR's that get around these checkpoints or it'll be rejected faster than
you can explain the reasons behind your PR.
